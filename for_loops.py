# # for loops = Execute a block a fixed number of times
# # while loops = Execute a block while a condition is true
# # break = Exit a loop prematurely
# # continue = Skip to the next iteration of a loop
# # pass = Do nothing, used when a statement is required syntactically but no execution of code
# # is necessary

# # for z in range(1,23):
#     print(z) # prints numbers from 1 to 22
#     # Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
#     # The range() function returns a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument up to, but not
#     # including, the second argument. The third argument is the step size, which defaults to
#     # 1 if not specified.
#     # The for loop iterates over the sequence returned by the range() function, printing each number
#     # in the sequence. The loop stops when it reaches the end of the sequence, which is
#     # determined by the second argument to the range() function.
#     # print("Hello, World!") # prints "Hello, World!" to the console
